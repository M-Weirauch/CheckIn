### Description

This system relies on routers to push to an api in order to get the currently logged on devices. With this method, any effort from the users can be avoided,
they will still have to login to use the aplications features, however they will be automatically marked as present as soon as one of their associated devices
connects to the wifi.

### Advantages

Easy Process, just connect to the wifi and you're in!

### Disadvantages

Hard first time data registering. All MAC Adresses have to be connected to a member.
